Of the apps which score 4.00 and above on both expert and user ratings, 60% contain a chatbot/AI feature (Youper, Woebot, Replika). This type of feature might improve the user experience on an app. Although it is also worth noting that our consumer rater was a young person. Raters noted the interactivity of the chatbot apps as“very engaging.” Other apps scoring 4.00+ across both ratings were Sanvello and Joyable. Although some community/forum apps (e.g. Wolf+Friends) received high scores, the lowest scoring apps tended to be those with community/forum features. All raters expressed concern about these types of apps, including that they “contain disturbing posts, no moderation, or really odd regulation rules (“ban those who mention suicide” in one of the two “Psychology” android apps)”.",Agree,Agree,Innovation,Design,Not sure about this but i believe it is all just about innovations.,Innovation,Design,Not sure,,Innovation,Design

Y1 Q3,Preliminary Learnings and Findings,Implementation Core,,"During our review we noted that app updates were frequent and unpredictable. Updates sometimes resulted in significant branding changes (e.g., Pacifica changing to Sanvello, Reachout changing to We Are More). There were also sometimes significant changes such as feature or pricing changes or important bug fixes that affected the usability of the app (e.g., Replika adding a subscription cost to access some of its features). In other instances, apps would become unavailable or inaccessible during the process of review, which indicates that it is important to consider the longevity of an app especially if adopting or recommending its use.",Agree,Agree,Innovation,Complexity,,Innovation,Complexity,,,Innovation,Complexity

Y1 Q3,Preliminary Learnings and Findings,Implementation Core,,"None of the apps we reviewed contained all of the 12 features assessed. As Table 3 demonstrates the range was 2 9 features with an average of 4.9. We also display the frequency that each feature appeared in one of the apps reviewed in Figure 6. As can be seen the most common features were interactive tools and didactic content, whereas the use of AI chatbot, link to services, and digital phenotyping were rarer. Interactive tools appeared in 76.5% of reviewed apps and didactic content in 70.5% whereas AI chatbots appeared in 17.6%, link to services in 8.8%, and digital phenotyping in 2.9%. This provides insight into what is available in the marketplace and demonstrates that it’s unlikely that any one app will meet all needs. Instead of looking for an app to meet every need, it may be valuable to prioritize needs and therefore prioritize some features over others. For example, as part of our stepped review process, we chose 4 features which were most representative of the features outlined in the components of the project: 24/7 support, 1 on 1 support, AI/chatbot and digital phenotyping. Of the 34 apps reviewed, 11 apps did not have any of these 4 features.

Y1 Q3,Preliminary Learnings and Findings,Implementation Core,,"The consumer ratings differed from the expert ratings. It is worth noting that the experts have rated hundreds of apps and may be looking for different aspects or might consider similar features differently based on this experience as well as expertise in psychology. This highlights the importance of understanding multiple viewpoints in app evaluation, including both top down (expert) and bottom up (consumer) ratings and feedback. Consumers might have positive views of an aspect that apps view negatively and vice versa. In this set of ratings, consumer ratings tended to be slightly more favorable (positive) than the experts’ ratings. It is also worth noting that our consumer rater opted not to review one app (Wolf+Friends) that they felt was not relevant to them.

Y1 Q3,Recommendations for Actions and Modifications,CalMHSA,,"Very few apps had identical patterns of features, demonstrating the variability in the features and functionality of mental health apps. Although two apps may look similar at face value (e.g. “Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) apps” or “mindfulness apps”), the patterns of features they contain are likely to differ. Also, it is important to note that even if an app claims to be based on an evidence based practice (like CBT), these apps often have considerable variability in their fidelity and representation of that evidence based practice. For example, a published review of 100 “CBT” apps found that only 10% contained features consistent with CBT and only 2 had contained more than 50% of qualifying ‘core principles’ of CBT (Huguet et al., 2016). Therefore, apps must be considered based not just on their claims but also by review of their content. The most common features in the apps we reviewed were interactive tools, didactic content, and 1 on 1 support. Only 2 apps linked users to offline services. A few apps (N = 5) had AI chatbots or programs with content (N = 6). With regards to digital phenotyping, we did not identify any apps other than Mindstrong with a digital phenotyping component from the searches. However, this was likely in part due to our methodology. We are modifying our methodology for the next round of market analysis to include both systematic search strategies and our own expertise in digital mental health to compile a broader list of relevant apps. This will help to capture and review other digital phenotyping apps (e.g. BiAffect, JOOL, CompanionMx, Ellipsis Health) in addition to other relevant apps which did not appear on our current list. We also considered Ginger.io, as it was an early product incorporating digital phenotyping for mental health, however, upon discussion with the Ginger.io team they are not currently using digital phenotyping in their platform. It is also important to note that not all apps are available on both iOS and Android operating systems (i.e., only available on iOS or vice versa), the two most dominant mobile operating systems on the market. Platform availability is therefore important to consider when aiming to capture a wider audience. Most users have access only to an iOS or Android device and are unlikely to purchase a new device to use a new app.",Agree,Agree,Innovation,Complexity,,Innovation,Complexity,,,Innovation,Complexity

This infor mation can inform future technologies to pilot or implement. Needs assessments conducted this quarter found:
o As noted in past reports, there are a range of language and linguistic needs within the target populations. Help@Hand has responded by forming the Cultural and Linguistic Adaptation workgroup in February 2020. In addition, language needs continue to be addressed during individual implementation calls. The Help@Hand Collaborative must consider apps that are sensitive to the preferred language and communication modalities of the target population, while recognizing that many digital mental health products are not available in multiple languages, reflecting a limitation of the marketplace. o Stigma surrounds mental health and those who seek help. Counties/Cities should keep this in mind when marketing and outreaching on technologies. For example, positive terms around healing were preferred over the term mental health among members of Riverside County’s Deaf and Hard of Hearing community. o Participants would like to access professional services and connect to other people. This can be useful to consider in thinking about the type of technologies that can support such needs. o Although participants in the needs assessments felt they had the resources necessary to use mental health apps, the use of mental health apps was relatively low.

The extent of support required may increase when technology exploration is done remotely. o Technologies that were evaluated were rated low on cultural sensitivity. Thus, cultural sensitivity is important to keep in mind when selecting technologies for particular target populations. o Learnings from Marin and San Mateo’s technology exploration with older adults reveal some users rated the usefulness of technologies differently when considering it for themselves compared to when they were considering the technology for a hypothetical broader population. Counties/Cities should not generalize these perceptions to the broader target audience since the technology explorations this quarter included a small number of participants.
